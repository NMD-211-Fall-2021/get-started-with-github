# Get started with Github
Here are some suggested activities for getting started with github. This is what we will work on as a class during the workshop.

## Pre Class Exercise
Watch videos 1 - 3 in the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLozRqGzj97d02YjR5JVqDwN2K0cAiT7VK&index=1) Git & Github for Poets videos.

### Extra resources
Unity has it's own text editor. 
Max doesn't need a text editor. 
But just in case you need text editors, two commonly used editors are [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). 

## Class 

1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account. 
2. Fork and edit the profile-list.md file in the repository [member-github-profiles](https://github.com/NMD-211-Fall-2021/member-github-profiles). Add message and commit and pull request to merge. Editing on main this once is ok.
3. Look at the branch history for this repository.
4. For *Katarina*: Add each member to the [NMD-211-Fall-2021](https://github.com/NMD-211-Fall-2021) organization 
5. In your teams: We will participate in an artistic version of I spy. 
   - Each member, initialize a repository. 
       - Add a text file,  `<lastname>-<firstname>-iSpy.txt`. The file should poetically or artistically describe some item that catches your eye from where you are seated in the room. The description in the file should not have a title, nor should it have a name that gives away the object. 
       - Commit, with a comment. 
   - Find one of your teammate's text files. Fork this teammate's text file. Create a new branch,  edit your teammate's file. Commit with a message. Make a pull request suggesting the title.
   - Look at the branch history.
   - If a teammate is having trouble, help. If you finish before the rest of the class, try managing an exchange where two people other than the author edit. Practice a few times, adding new information or edits.
6. Using the command line / terminal in conjunction with git
   - Follow steps [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) or along with Katarina to Install and Configure Git. Help any confused teammates.
7. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your iSpy repository. Katarina will demonstrate how to do so using https.
   - Clone the repo. Check out a branch. pull origin branch.
   - Make a change. Commit with message. Push to the origin branch. 
      - you can repeat this as many times as you like, if you're making many changes.    
   - Checkout main. pull origin main. merge branch. push origin main.
8. Initialize a new repository on your laptop. 
   - Create a folder. Add some file - say an old processing homework. Or a picture. Or a text file. 
   - [`git init`](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init#git-init-one-person-starting-a-new-repository-locally) the repository. Follow the steps for one person starting a new repository locally. There's one difference: the old version of git used `master` as the main branch, but now it has `main`, so the last step should be `git push -u origin main`


That's it! Now you know all the basic things you need to use github. 

Common errors happen when you merge badly. (ELABORATE - branches, merge history, prs , text editors )
